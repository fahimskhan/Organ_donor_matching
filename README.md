# Organ_donor_matching

This code generates a sample population of couples and randomly assigns blood
type to each. It then randomly selects a number of couples where one
of the couples require an organ transplant. It then tries to match
blood types between couples. The ones that are not matched are tried to
be crossmatched and if still not matched, put on a list to be matched
with a randomly generated donor pool. It then gives the number of
people who have successfully been matched and those who have not.
